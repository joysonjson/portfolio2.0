Here’s your message with corrections and some minor adjustments for clarity and flow:

I don’t want to pretend to be someone I am not. Whatever I’ve shared about myself is true, though I might have come across as too orthodox or spiritual. As much as I am spiritual, I am also practical and consider myself an open-minded person.

I’m not sure if these are right or wrong, but here are a few things I feel a bit guilty about:

	1.	I do listen to secular music.
	2.	I watch movies, and in the past, I felt it was becoming somewhat addictive. It wasn’t working out for me, so I tried shifting to anime to manage the urge to watch movies. Today, I can confidently say that I am not addicted to movies. I occasionally watch them based on my interests or if someone with similar taste recommends one.
	3.	I consider myself responsible with money, though I sometimes spend a little more than I should. If I’m buying something expensive, it has to sit in my cart for a certain period before I purchase it—no impulsive buying.
	4.	At the office, I do sit with colleagues during outings or dinners when they drink. This is different from my personal friends, as I can choose them based on my values, and I keep my distance from those who drink. With colleagues, especially since I work remotely and we only gather twice a year, it becomes challenging to avoid these social gatherings entirely.
	5.	I have missed attending some Sundays (maybe once a year), and only if there’s an office gathering. I never plan personal travel on Sundays, but if I do, I make it a point to attend a church service wherever I am.
	6.	There are times when I haven’t read the Bible consistently. So far, I haven’t completed reading the Bible from start to finish in one stretch. I’ve tried many times but have only finished the New Testament. I’m fairly sure I’ve read most of it, just not in order.

Let me know if this captures what you wanted to express, or if you’d like further adjustments!
